Data exploration is a cornerstone of any meaningful data analysis. The quality of the tools used in this initial phase can greatly influence the success of the project.  
Sweetviz is an open-source Python library that generates beautiful, high-density visualizations to kickstart Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with just two lines of code. The output is a fully self-contained HTML application.  

The system is designed to quickly visualize target values and compare datasets. Its goal is to facilitate rapid analysis of target features, training data versus test data, and other similar data characterization tasks.
